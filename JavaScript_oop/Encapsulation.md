Grouping Data & Actions Encapsulation bundles data (variables) and methods (functions) together within an object. 
ðŸŸª Hides Complexity It hides the inner workings, allowing interaction only through a set of well-defined methods 
ðŸŸª Data Protection Protects data from direct access or modification from outside the object ðŸŸª Controlled Access Enables controlled access to the data, ensuring it's only changed in expected ways. 
ðŸŸª Enhances Maintainability Encapsulation makes code more manageable by organizing related functionalities and protecting internal data
