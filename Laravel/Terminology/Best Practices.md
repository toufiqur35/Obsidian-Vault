**Response Body**
* Avoid providing response status, code, message via response body 
* Use JSON best practices for JSON response body. 
* For single result, can use String, Boolean directly. 
* Provide proper JSON encode-decode before writing JSON Body.
* Follow discussion on JSON described before.
**Response Cookies:**
* A Restful API may send cookies just like a regular Web Application that serves HTML 
* Avoid using response cookies as it is violate stateless principle.
* If required use cookie encryption, decryption and other policies

**Response Header**
* Provide proper http response status code. 
* Provide proper content type, file type if any.
* Provide cache status if any. 
* Authentication token should provide via response header.
* Only string data is allowed for response header. 
* Provide content length if any. 
* Provide response date and time. 
* Follow request-response model described before.

**Request Body**
* Request body should be structured in JSON Array/ Object pattern 
* Request body hold multipart/ form-data like images, audio, video `etc` 
* Request body should not hold any `auth` related information. 
* Request body should associated with specific request data model, setter getter can used for this

**Request Header**
* Request header should carry all security related information, like token, `auth` etc. 
* Only string` Key:Pair` value is allowed for header . 
* Request header should provide user agent information of client application.
* If necessary CSRF/XSRF should provide via header.
* Request header should associated with middleware controller, where necessary

**Controller Best Practices**
* The controllers should always be as clean as possible. We shouldnâ€™t place any business logic inside it.
* Controllers should be responsible for accepting http request 
* Consider API versioning 
* Use `async/await` if at all possible. 
* Follow solid principles to manage controller classes. 
* Mention which method is responsible for GET() and which for POST(). 
* Controller should be only responsible for calling model, return response , redirect to action etc.

**Middleware Controller Best Practices**
* Use to implement API key, user-agent restriction, CSRF, XSRF security, token based API authentication. 
* Use to implement API request rate limit. 
* Logging of incoming HTTP requests. 
* Redirecting the users based on requests.
* Middleware can inspect a request and decorate it, or reject it, based on what it finds. 
* Middleware is most often considered separate from your application logic. 
* Middleware gives you enough freedom to create your own security mechanism.
