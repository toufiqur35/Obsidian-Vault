| Restrictions on data length | Yes, when sending data, the GET method adds the data to the URL; and the length of a URL is limited (maximum URL length is 2048 characters)              | No restrictions                                                                                                |

| Security                    | GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL  <br>  <br>Never use GET when sending passwords or other sensitive information! | POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs |
