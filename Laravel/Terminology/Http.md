#### Http Client
Postman is an HTTP client application, used to test request response communication.
Postman is widely used for API testing and generating documentation.

* Quickly and easily send REST,SOAP and `GrapgQl` requests directly within postman. 
* Generate and publish beautiful, machine readable API.
* Checking performance and response times at scheduled intervals.
* Communicate the expected behavior of an API by simulating endpoint and their responses.
#### Http Request Segments:
* HTTP Request is the first step to initiate web request/response communication. Every request is a combination of request header, body and request URL.

| Request Area  | Standard Data Type                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Body          | Simple String, JSON, Download, Redirect, XML |
| Header        | Key Pair Value                               |
| URL Parameter | String                                       |

### Http Request Throttling 
**Throttle Request refers to a process in which a user is allowed to hit the application maximum time in per second or per minute. Throttling is also known as request rate limiting.** 
* Essential component of Internet security, as `DoS` attacks can tank a server with unlimited requests.
* Rate limiting also helps make your API scalable by avoid unexpected spikes in traffic, causing severe lag time.

#### Http Response Segments
Http response is the final step of request-response communication. Every response is a combination of response header, body and cookies.

| Request Area  | Standard Data Type                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Body          | Simple String, JSON, Download, Redirect, XML |
| Header        | Key Pair Value                               |
| URL Parameter | String                                       |
