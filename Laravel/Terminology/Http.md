Postman is widely used for API testing and generating documentation.

* Quickly and easily send REST,SOAP and `GrapgQl` requests directly within postman. 
* Generate and publish beautiful, machine readable API.
* Checking performance and response times at scheduled intervals.
* Communicate the expected behavior of an API by simulating endpoint and their responses.
