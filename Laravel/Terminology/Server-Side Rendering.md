* With server-side rendering, the HTML of the page is generated on a server for each request. 
* The generated HTML, JSON data, and JavaScript instructions to make the page interactive are then sent to the client.

#### BENEFITS OF SSR
**Better SEO**
* Server-side rendering allows search engine bots to crawl and index the content of your website easily, leading to better search engine rankings.
**Faster initial loading**
* Server-side rendering provides faster initial loading of web pages by sending HTML content to the browser before the JavaScript is executed. This helps reduce page load time and improves user experience.
**Improved accessibility**
* Server-side rendering can improve website accessibility by ensuring that content is available to all users, including those with slow or unreliable internet connections, or those using assistive technologies.
**Improved security:**
* Server-side rendering can improve website security by reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that are common with client-side rendering.
**Better performance on low-powered devices:**
* Server-side rendering can improve the performance of web pages on low-powered devices such as mobile phones and tablets by reducing the processing requirements on the client-side.

#### OPPOSITE OF SSR
**Higher server load**
* Server-side rendering requires more server resources to generate and serve pages, which can increase server load and affect website performance.
**Limited interactivity** 
* Server-side rendering does not allow for complex interactive features that require heavy client-side processing, such as real-time updates or animations.
**Limited flexibility** 
* Server-side rendering may limit the ability to customize the user interface or provide personalized experiences, as the HTML is generated on the server.
**Higher development costs**
* Server-side rendering may require additional development resources and expertise, leading to higher development costs.
**Complexity**
* Implementing server-side rendering can be complex and require specific technologies and configurations, which can be difficult for some developers to manage.
