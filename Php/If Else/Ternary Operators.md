It is called a ternary operator because it takes three operands- a condition, a result statement for true, and a result statement for false. The syntax for the ternary operator is as follows.
```php
(Condition) ? (Statement1) : (Statement2);
```

```php
$age = 20;  
print ($age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Not Adult";
```
