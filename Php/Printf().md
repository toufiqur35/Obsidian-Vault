PHP, the `printf` function is used for formatted output. It allows you to print formatted strings with placeholders that can be replaced by values.
```php
$name = "sobuj"; 
$age = 24; 
printf("Name: %s, Age: %d", $name, $age);
```
Here **%s** is a placeholder for a string, and %d is a placeholder for an integer. The` printf `function replaces these placeholders with the values of $name and $age ,
