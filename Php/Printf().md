PHP, the `printf` function is used for formatted output. It allows you to print formatted strings with placeholders that can be replaced by values.
```php
$name = "sobuj"; 
$age = 24; 
printf("Name: %s, Age: %d", $name, $age);
```
Here ***%s*** is a placeholder for a string, and %d is a placeholder for an integer. The` printf `function replaces these placeholders with the values of $name and $age .

#### PHP `printf()` placeholders
%s is used for inserting strings into the formatted output.
```php
$name = "sobuj"; 
printf("Name: %s", $name);
```

`%d or %i` is used for inserting signed decimal integers into the formatted output.
```php
$age = 24;  
printf("Age: %d", $age);
```

%f is used for inserting floating-point (decimal) numbers into the formatted output.
```php
$price = 19.99; 
printf("Price: %.2f", $price);

//output: Price: FF
```

%x is used for inserting lowercase hexadecimal numbers into the formatted output.
```php
$hexValue = 255;  
printf("Hex Value: %x", $hexValue);

//output: Hex Value: ff
```

%X - Uppercase Hexadecimal Number
```php
$hexValue = 255; 
printf("Hex Value: %X", $hexValue);

//output: Hex Value: FF
```
