#### Variable Naming Conventions
* Variable names in PHP start with a dollar sign ($) 
* The name must begin with a letter or underscore ( _ ) , followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. 
* Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning $myVariable and $myvariable are treated as different variables. 
* PHP does not require you to declare a variable before using it ; it automatically creates the variable when you assign a value to it.
```php
$name="John"; 
$age=30;
```
